# TheCurseOfMen
Prof and evedenice that I have got what it takes for my FYP at staffordshire university



Introduction
Hello my name is nicholas street and this is my profolio based on the course Indivdual Games Technology in staffordshire Uni. In this protfoilo I would demonstate my capability of acheving what I would like to make during the end of this academic year. The idea is a 3rd person open world game that is based around games that I took inspiration by, assassins creed, batman , shadow of mordor and Darksiders 2 through these inspirations it helps me with the end result of the game that I want to create.



Inspiration focus:
Through this part of the documentation this would show what mechanic or sections of the story that I took an interest and why this would be in my game with diagrams to show how I would tackle this personally using a complely different engine that they orginally used.

Assassins Creed origins free running:
Through the assassins creed franchise theirs was always that mechanic that made it stand out from other games, free running. Climbing walls, jumping from rooftop to rooftop, going through anywhere everywhere that they can and any possible opstion is avaible to the player.The reason why I choose this mechanic is beacause I want players to have their own unqiue style of gameplay to give players the options to pick what areas they want to fight or to go to the sealthy apporach. 

Through these images show a break down of each movement while climbing, grabbing on a ledges and falling down to have that free and so that players have a different options of height that the player can go:

Extention: For something that I can do extra I could add object or obsticals on the wall and being able to grab onto anything if I manage to do this it would give me more a realistic and more of a free running experience.

Batman AI Fighting style:
In the batman games theirs been a machanic that I always wanted to try that I didn't know how to tackle this machanic, The AI performance of how enemies an random start to attck the player making the gameplay unpredickable and making the player be more aware of their surounding and feels more realistic through a real fight.

Through these images it shows what I think the AI enemeis behave while they are in a fighting state:

Prof that I can do it: 
Through this part of the documentation I will show you the projects that I've done over the summber, little projects that I've done through the years that I wanted to know about, mechanics that I've recently made and recourse that I would use to make that mechanic.
